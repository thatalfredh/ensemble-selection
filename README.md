[Paper by Rich Caruana et al.](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~alexn/papers/shotgun.icml04.revised.rev2.pdf)

Why Ensemble Selection?

- Demonstrated better performance in Kaggle and other ML competitions
- Easy application - train a bunch of models, apply selection, get ensemble
- Suitable for neural networks 

TO DO:
- update algorithm
- refactor
- include modified examples (current one sensitive)
